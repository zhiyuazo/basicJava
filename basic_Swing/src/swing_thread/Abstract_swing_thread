Three kind Threads:

no.1 Init-thread(Thread-end when create and display completed): 
	 a. create  container(JFrame) or JButton..etc's components
	 b. display container(JFrame) or JButton..etc's components
	 
no.2 Event-dispatch-thread
	a. all action relate with Event (button.addActionListener)
	b. the thread is single-thread because(JTextFiled,JButton) are not safe between thread.
	c. (JTextFiled,JButton) may invoked by a lot of thread to invoke thread-problem
	d. so , design the Event-dispatch-thread as a single-thread

no.3 long-time thread 
	a. access database
	b. file copy
	c. connection to network
	d. etc
	e. User will feel the UI was stuck , so those actions will be placed in long-time-thread


tips:
	create/display job also should be handled by Event-dispatch-thread
